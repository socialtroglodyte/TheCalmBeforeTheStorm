This mod adds an event that takes some inspiration from the "You Have One Day" challenge. Zombies migrate away from the player and form massive hordes, which, after a certain period of time, return to hunt the player. This mod is intended to work for both singleplayer and multiplayer. This will work on both new and existing saves.

The event cycles through three phases:

- The Cooldown Phase - The time between events. Gameplay is normal and zombies will behave as usual.
- The 'Calm' Phase - The period in which mass zombie migration occurs. Towns and cities will seem deserted and eerily quiet. This gives players the opportunity to scavenge and build defences before the inevitable horde arrives.
- The 'Storm' Phase - Zombies return in large numbers as one massive horde and persistently hunt down the player(s). Zombies are always aware of the player's position (this can be disabled in custom sandbox). Players will be notified of the start of the storm phase by the sound of wind and distant zombie noises.

Note that unlike mods such as Horde Night and Here They Come, this does not spawn any zombies, but rather moves the existing ones in the world to form hordes.

The mod is very customizable through the custom sandbox menu and allows you to adjust the duration of each phase, as well as the radius and distance of the horde. If you are adjusting the phase durations mid-game, the changes will take effect after the storm phase concludes.
